(you will not need to access your email) You will be taken to the student registration page, where you will need to click on
the "Begin Registration" button to setup your student account. You will then have to input your personal information
in the 6 step registration process. This is the quickest way to get started on your Training straight away</p><p>Please remember the details you enter when you create your student account will need to be correct in content and spelling
to ensure no unnecessary delays in the issuing of your RSA Certificate.</p><p><i>Second option:</i> If you would like to register your account and enrol at a later time, you will receive a confirmation
email after you have purchased your course. This email will contain your enrolment code. If you cannot find this email, check
your spam or junk email folder. If you click on the enrolment code in that email, you will be taken to the student registration
page, whereby if you already have an account you can login and add the new course, or you will need to click on the
"Begin Registration" button. You will then have to input your personal information in the 6 step registration process
to get started with your training.</p><h3><a id=pass_course></a>Is it possible to fail the course?</h3><p>Yes it is possible to fail the course, if you get locked out of too many questions and the trainers can see that you are not
understanding the learning material. In this case you may be offered an alternative training option or given a refund in line
with the refund policy.</p><p>When you are completing your Online RSA training, you will have 3 attempts per question.</p><p>If you exceed your allotted 3 attempts on a question you will be locked out of your course. This lockout system is
implemented to ensure that students who are having difficulty answering questions or understanding the course materials, take
the time to re-read the relevant training material and receive assistance when required.</p><p>To have your account unlocked, please <a href=https://elp.freshdesk.com/en/support/home target=_blank>submit a ticket</a>
with a request to have your account unlocked. Please note that your request can only be processed Monday - Friday between
the hours of 9 AM to 5 PM.</p><p>If you then incorrectly answer the same question another 3 times we will organise to have your details referred to a trainer
who can give assistance in understanding the Training Material. Please note that it may take up to 4 hours during business
days for a trainer to contact you about your course. There is NO additional fee charged for this service.</p><p>When answering questions, please ensure that you enter the correct number of responses; if the question is asking you for 3
responses, you must submit at least 3 responses or your answer will be marked as being incorrect by the marking team.</p><p>If you finding difficulty in completing the questions due to having difficulty understanding the material or content, we can
provide access to fully qualified trainers to assist.</p><h3><a id=rsa_under_18></a>Can under 18s do the training?</h3><p>Yes. Whilst the target age for this training is 18 years and over, anyone 16 and older can do their RSA online.<p>Please note: If you under 18 you will not be able to serve liquor yet, but it is a great qualification to have if you want to
work in the hospitality industry and employers would see this as an advantage in hiring you. So definitely make sure you add
it to your resume, when you have received your certificate.</p><p>Please contact your State/Territory to find out more about serving requirements.</p><h3><a id=rsa_usi></a>Do I need a Unique Student Identifier (USI)?</h3><p>Yes. From the 1st of January 2015 everyone undertaking nationally recognised training in Australia must have a unique
student identifier.</p><p>During our course enrolment process you will be asked to provide a USI.</p><p>In rare circumstances you may need to speak directly with the
<a href=https://www.usi.gov.au/ title="rsa usi" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">government USI
Department</a> to provide further details. We will notify you if this is the case.</p><p>The following video explains USI.</p><iframe loading=lazy width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QD8eXcYvlNk title="USI for students video" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><h3><a id=time_to_complete_rsa></a>How long does it take to complete the course?</h3><p>The course is set up in different subject sections with an online assessment after each section. You can come and go as
often as you please; the system will save your progress.</p><p>However, if you want to do it in one session, most people take about 4-6 hours (but this will depend on your experience,
internet speed, literacy and other factors). There is up to 50 hours of additional supporting documentation.</p><p>In order to keep your assessment valid you must complete your course fully within 12 weeks of purchase and you will find
it easier if you put in the effort to complete the training in under a week while the information is fresh in your mind.</p><h3><a id=reattempt_questions_or_quizes></a>How many times can I reattempt questions?</h3><p>You can attempt each assessment question three times on you own. If you exceed this limit you will be prevented from
continuing until you have gotten in touch with one of our trainers to help you understand the material.</p><h3><a id=difficulties></a>What if I am having any difficulties?</h3><p>If you are having difficulties understanding any aspect of the training, then by all means you should get in touch with
our trainers who will be more than happy to help you understand and get through.<p></p>See <a href=#how_to_get_help>how can I get help?</a></p><h3><a id=how_to_get_help></a>How can I get help?</h3><p>First check the frequently asked questions. If you cannot find an answer, then the quickest and most efficient way to get
help is to lodge a support ticket and our trainers will reply or call you back as appropriate, asap.</p><p>You may also leave a voicemail message and we will return your call, but please note these are checked less often than
support tickets.</p><p>Unlike some other unscrupulous providers we have heard of, there are no additional fees incurred to get help from our
trainers, it is just part of the service!</p><h3><a id=come_and_go></a>Can I come and go as often as I like and will the system remember where I am up to?</h3><p>Yes. Simply make sure when you want to exit you do so by closing the screen using the X button in the top right corner of
the screen, or click the Return to the Main Menu link. The next time you log in the system will ask "Do you want to start
where you left off?" and you should click yes.</p><h3><a id=time_to_complete></a>How long do I have to complete the training?</h3><p>You have 12 weeks to complete the training and assessment, after which we reserve the right to cancel or reset your training.
You can work on your course at any time of the day or night, and it is not necessary that you complete the training all in
one sitting. Your progress is automatically saved so you can come back and resume your course at a later time. You do not
need to complete your course the same day you start it.</p><h3><a id=as_good_as_in_class_training></a>Is online training as good as in class
training?</h3><p>Yes and in some cases like this online rsa course, online training has even better learning outcomes as well as other
advantages. In class training means you have to learn at the rate of the slowest students. Our online training is
interactive, more engaging and entertaining and allows students to spend more time on the areas that they find the most
challenging.</p><h3><a id=review_content_before_quiz></a>Can I review the content of a section again before
taking the assessment?</h3><p>Yes you can and should review the section materials before attempting the assessment. If you try to guess answers you will
certainly end up locked out, which requires you to contact a trainer to continue.</p><p>You can return to the course menu and review the section materials if you need to refresh your memory.</p><h3><a id=change_spelling_rsa></a>I've made a typo when entering my name or other details, can
I change it?</h3><p>Not directly. However, you can log into your student portal and under your profile submit a change of details electronic
form. Alternatively you can raise a support ticket with your account details, identify yourself and then our support
staff will be able to make the necessary changes to your account.</p><h3><a id=practical_demonstration_rsa></a>What about practical Demonstration of skills?</h3><p>We have a number of interactive video exercises within the online RSA training course which will help you understand the
training material better and put your new knowledge into practice. You will need to video your skills and submit them to
a trainer for assessment.</p><h3><a id=rsafast></a>What is the fastest way to get my RSA certificate?</h3><p>Most people are in a hurry to get their RSA certificate and start their new job. The fastest way to get your certificate is
to submit all of your identity documents at the start, rather than waiting till the end, as these documents can take some
time to be validated. If possible do your training during business hours so that you can contact trainers if needed.
Next DO NOT TRY TO GUESS ANSWERS, instead make sure you fully understand the learning material and get the questions right
on your first attempt.</p><p>See <a href=#reattempt_questions_or_quizes>How many times can I reattempt questions?</a></p><p>See <a href=#difficulties>What if I am having any difficulties?</a></p></div></div><div class=span4><aside><section class=content-view-aside></section></aside></div></article></section></div></div></div><footer><div class=hr></div><div class=container><div class=row><div id=search_criteria class=span12><p>KEYWORDS: <span class=terms><span class=terms>RSA Online, RSA Online Training, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training/RSA-Online-NSW-New-South-Wales-RSA-Certificate.html>RSA Online NSW</a>, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training/RSA-Online-QLD-Queensland-RSA-Certificate.html>RSA Online QLD</a>, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training/RSA-Online-WA-Western-Australia-RSA-Certificate.html>RSA Online WA</a>, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training/RSA-Online-NT-Northern-Territory-RSA-Certificate.html>RSA Online NT</a>, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training/RSA-Online-ACT-Australian-Capital-Territory-RSA-Certificate.html>RSA Online ACT</a>, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training/RSA-Online-SA-South-Australia-RSA-Certificate.html>RSA Online SA</a>, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training/RSA-Online-TAS-Tasmania-RSA-Certificate.html>RSA Online TAS</a>, <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training.html>RSA Online All States</a> RSA Certificate (Responsible Service of Alcohol) save time do RSA training when you want.
