Therefore it is not possible to do one single course that will satisfy all requirements for all states, but, you are able to bridge your
qualification to the other states.</p><p>Our recommendation is that you should choose the state where you are most likely to start working and complete that course, making sure to
click on all of the available state variations when you come to the map sections. Once you have your Provide Responsible Service of Alcohol
SITHFAB021 statement of attainment, it will be recognised in TAS, WA, NT, SA, ACT, & QLD. If you did not choose NSW or VIC as your
first choice, you can then do the free online bridging courses for those states, if and when you need to work there.</p><p>The VIC government's bridging course is currently free. The NSW government ultimately levies an additional fee for their photo competency
card scheme and at the time of writing this fee is set at $97.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/apply-rsa-competency-card-nsw-rsa-bridging-applicants target=_blank>NSW online bridging course</a> - free, but please note you will still need to pay for your NSW competency card.</li><li><a href=https://liquor.vcglr.vic.gov.au/rsa_refresher/BridgingCourseApplication.aspx target=_blank>VIC online bridging course</a> - free.</li></ul><p>See <a href=/rsa/RSA-Online-Training.html>each states course page</a> for full details, or continue reading below.</p><h3><a id=queensland_rsa></a>What is required to work in the liquor Industry in Queensland (QLD)?</h3><p>The Nationally Accredited Provide Responsible Service of Alcohol SITHFAB021 (RSA) online training course that we offer is the most
